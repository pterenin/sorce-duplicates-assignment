# Getting Started with Blog App

This is TypeScript version of the find duplication solution. It's implemented unit tests using jest.

1. Clone the project. 
2. Run **npm install** to install node modules
3. Run **tsc** to compile TS files into ready to run JS files
4. Run **node dist/index.js** to run the app and see the results in the node.js terminal
5. Run **npm test**  to run unit tests
